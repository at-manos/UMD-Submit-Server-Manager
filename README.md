# UMD Submit Server Manager

This is a student-made extension that allows you to submit straight from VSCode instead of having to use Eclipse.

## Commands

- "Submit to UMD Submit Server"
  - Submits the code in your current project folder to the UMD Submit Server.
  - Accessible from the command palette or right clicking the folder in the explorer.

## Notes

- This is still a very young extension, and more features and robustness is planned for the future. 

- Don't fret: I actually use this, so I sort of have to maintain it.
